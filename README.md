 ![Addon icon](icons/reply-all.svg) Reply All Button
====================================================

Does Thunderbird's Smart Reply button keep defaulting to "Reply List"
despite your mailing list community preferring the semantics of "Reply
All"?

Add a separate Reply All button which can replace SmartReply in your message
tab and will only ever Reply All without switching to Reply List.

## Notes

You will need to configure the message display tab to remove the Smart Reply
and add the Reply All button.

## Installation

### From Thunderbird's Add-Ons Platform

[Reply All Button on addons.thunderbird.net](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/reply-all-button).

### Manual Installation

Pack the add-on as an .xpi file and install it from the “gear” menu in
Thunderbird's add-on manager.

On UNIX-like systems, you can create the .xpi file by simply running:

    $ cd seams/
    $ make
